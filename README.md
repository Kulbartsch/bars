# bars

_Visualize numbers with ease! In the terminal or for web pages._

**A CLI tool to generate bar charts as (colored) text or HTML, written in Go**

**bars** follows the Unix philosophy:
> Write programs that do one thing and do it well.  
> Write programs to work together.  
> Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

## Example 

Displaying the disk usage as bars:

    $  du -b *
    60      bill.txt
    237     performance.txt
    115     temperatur.txt

Each input line is split up into an _value_ and _label_ part. 
By default, the output is _label_, _value_ and _bars_:

    $  du -b * | ../bars --ascii
    bill.txt         60 ###############
    performance.txt 237 ############################################################
    temperatur.txt  115 #############################

There are parameters to accept units in the values, 
use a comma instead of a dot as a decimal separator 
and more.
